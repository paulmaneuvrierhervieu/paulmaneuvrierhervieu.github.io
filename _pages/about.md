<br>I am an Associate Professor (Maître de conférences) at the Department of Economics at the [University of Paris 8](https://www.univ-paris8.fr/) and a member of the Dionysian Economics Lab ([LED](https://sites.google.com/site/up8led/)).

Prior to joining the University of Paris 8, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Milan](https://www.unimi.it/en/ugov/person/paul-maneuvrier) for the ERC project [DESPO](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/853033) (De-industrializing Societies and the Political Consequences), I also worked at the University of Geneva and at the University of Caen where I obtained my PhD in 2020. I have also been a visiting researcher at the University of Chicago.

<bre>**What's new?**: Happy to announce the publication of my latest paper in Electoral Studies entitled "Cultivating Trust? The Role of European Union Investments in Bridging Rural-Urban Divides" [doi](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.electstud.2025.102987)



<br>**Research interests**: Economic history; Political Science; Deindustrialization; International Trade; Economic Development; Living standards; Atlantic history; Medieval history; Industrialization; Archeology

<br>My research explores the long-term consequences of economic development by analyzing the evolution of living standards from the Middle Ages through the 19th century. I also examine the social and political impact of the 1786 Eden Treaty—considered the first free trade agreement—signed between France and England in 1786.

A significant part of my work focuses on historical social conflicts. In 2020, together with [Cédric Chambru](https://cedricchambru.github.io/), I launched the Historical Social Conflict Database [(HiSCoD)](https://www.unicaen.fr/hiscod/). Designed for both academic researchers and the general public, HiSCoD offers a comprehensive set of resources for studying social unrest from the Middle Ages to the 19th century. The current version includes over 20,000 recorded episodes of conflict across France, England, Germany, Italy, Spain, and other regions.

I am also a waterpolo player and I love spending time outdoors, roaming the valleys of Normandy birdwatching.
