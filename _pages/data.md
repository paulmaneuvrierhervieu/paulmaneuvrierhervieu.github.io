### Historical Social Conflict Database (HiSCoD)
Together with [Cédric Chambru](https://cedricchambru.github.io/), I developed the [Historical Social Conflict Database (HiSCoD)](https://mrsh.unicaen.fr/hiscod/accueil.html). In its currrent form, it lists information on more than 20,000 epsiodes of social conflict between the 12th century and the late 19th century. The website was created using the XML-EAD format and built with the [Pôle Document Numérique de la Maison de la Recherche en Sciences Humaines (MRSH)](https://mrsh.unicaen.fr/pluridisciplinaire/pole-document-numerique/) at the University of Caen Normandy. 

Raw data are available in csv format in the [Github repository](https://github.com/hiscod/hiscod-project) of the project. 

For more details on the construction of the database, please see the [data paper](https://doi.org/10.1017/S000305542300076X).  

### United States data
As part of my postdoctoral research, I began developing a comprehensive database that explores the economic and social history of the United States at the county level.

This ongoing project brings together data on trade unions, labor strikes, manufacturing employment, the American labor movement, and the process of deindustrialization. The goal is to provide a rich, county-level resource for understanding the dynamics of labor and industry across U.S. history.

### Economic and social History of Normandy 
I am currently preparing the publication of a detailed database that documents the economic, social, and demographic history of Normandy at the parish level.
This project compiles a wide range of data, including population estimates from tax records (1300–1600), inequality, industrial activity, and historical geographic datasets (GIS). These spatial layers include road networks, maréchaussée brigades, parish boundaries (18th century), and administrative divisions such as cantons in 1790.

### Primary Schools in Early Modern Normandy 
I am currently working on a new database project by collecting data on primary schools at the parish level (1300-1800). The aim is to provide a better understanding of the development of elementary school networks and contribute to the long-standing debate on the role of education in economic development during the pre-industrial era.
